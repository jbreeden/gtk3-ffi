gtk3-ffi (Abandoned)
====================

Ruby FFI bindings to gtk3, generated with ffi_gen. After experimenting with JRuby + JavaFX (too slow to start), wxWidgets + CRuby (too painful to develop), this was my next best guess for a GUI development story with Ruby. The generated bindings seemed to work fine, but what I *really* wanted was simple HTML & JavaScript UIs, access to all the excellent JavaScript libraries I know, and all the Ruby libraries I love. If you could throw in V8's speed and blink's rendering engine, that'd be nice too. So [lamina](http://github.com/jbreeden/lamina) was born.
